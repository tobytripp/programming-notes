* Book Notes

  Notes taken while reading: _The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and
  Programming_ Second Edition, by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck.

** Using these Notes

   The source code embedded in the notes can be extracted by
   "tangling."  Tangle the code with the Emacs command
   =(org-babel-tangle)= bound by default to =C-c C-x v t=.  I've bound
   it also to =F6=.

   Some of the notes contain mathematical notation.  This is most
   easily read after exporting the file to html.  The default command
   for this is bound to =C-c C-e h h=.  Once you've entered =C-c C-e=
   (for "export"), you'll start to see options for other export
   formats.
